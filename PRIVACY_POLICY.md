# Privacy Policy for Tagda Fun

**Last updated:** August 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Tagda Fun! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## About Tagda Fun

Tagda Fun is a simple, offline-first mobile application that generates random numbers based on user-defined ranges and randomly selects names from user-provided lists. Our app is designed to be fun, lightweight, and privacy-focused, perfect for decision-making, games, and random selections.

## Information We Collect

### ✅ What We DO Collect/Store (Device-only, non-personal):
- **No personal information is collected**
- **No analytics or tracking data**
- **Coin Toss stats (wins/losses)** are stored locally on your device to show your history. You can reset these at any time from within the app. These stats never leave your device.
- **Names and numbers you enter** are processed locally in memory for the current session only and are not uploaded anywhere.

### ❌ What We DON'T Collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Device information or unique identifiers
- Location data
- Usage analytics or behavior tracking
- Any data that could identify you personally
- Names you enter for random selection (not stored by us; only processed in memory on your device)
- Numbers you generate or ranges you set (not stored by us)

## How Our App Works

### Offline Functionality
- Tagda Fun works completely offline
- No internet connection is required
- All number generation and name selection happens locally on your device

### Data Processing
- **Number Generation**: Uses local device processing with `Math.random()`
- **Name Selection**: Processes names you enter locally, no server involvement
- **No Data Storage**: Names and numbers are processed in memory only
- **No Cloud Storage**: Nothing is saved or synchronized

### Name Picker Feature
- Names you enter are processed locally on your device
- Names are not stored, saved, or transmitted anywhere
- Each name selection is a fresh random choice from your input
- Clearing names removes them from memory immediately

### Truth & Dare Feature
- Requires entering player names (alphabets only); all processing is local to your device
- A colorful spinning wheel runs locally to select a player at random
- No player names are stored or transmitted; names exist only in memory during the session

### Coin Toss Feature
- Lets you pick Heads or Tails and flips a 3D coin animation locally
- The result (win/lose) is calculated on-device and shown to you
- Win/Loss counters are saved locally on your device so you can track your history
- You can reset these counters at any time; nothing is synced or uploaded

## Third-Party Services
